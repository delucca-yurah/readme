## About this Organization

This organization is dedicated to hosting all source code that I have wrote to Yurah and it is currently open sourced. There are a bunch of stuff that either my partner or my investors decided not to allowed to make public, so if something is missing here probably is was decided to not be avaiable.

There is a lot of rules that maybe would look confusing or not intuitive, because you cannot see a big picture abouot the entire architecture. Most of our architecture was running on RabbitMQ using messaging queues, so there can be some concepts that you can fell lost or not understand completly.

If you want to ask any questions or talk to be about any specific decision that I've made, you can send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_odelucca) or through [e-mail](mailto:delucca@pm.me).
